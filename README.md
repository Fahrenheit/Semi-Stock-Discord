# Semi Stock Discord
A theme I've put together with minor tweaks and some snippets to personalize my experience. It unintentionally seems to mimic the iOS Discord style.
 
 This theme is mainly built for macOS, however I have added experimental Windows support. My macOS title bar modification implementation is a bit hacky so I'll fix that at some point.The Windows window controls may have some issues so please report them if you find any.
**If you have any platform specific issues please report them to me (My handle is Fahrenheight#0001.**

Use this with [HorizontalServerList](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList) by [GibbuPCStuff](https://github.com/GibbuPCStuff/) and [Bottom Bar](https://github.com/luckfire/bottombar) by [LuckFire](https://github.com/luckfire/)
 ## Installation

### Powercord

1. Clone the theme repositories with this single command `cd powercord/src/powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/Fahrenheit/Semi-Stock-Discord && git clone https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList && git clone https://github.com/luckfire/bottombar` 
2. Install [Theme Toggler](https://github.com/redstonekasi/theme-toggler) and enable all 3 themes.
3. *Optional* There are a few optional minor tweaks available if you edit the `semi-stock.css` file. Delete the lines instructed to enable the code. For example you can add message bubbles to the theme or add back the Discord logo on Windows.

**I can promise you this will be broken and look awful if you don't use those themes with this as it was built with these two in mind.**

## Credits

*Thank you to Doggybootsy#1333 for the help working on the Windows support.*

*All credit goes to them for their respective themes. I just built upon them and did some slight modifications here and there. There are other credit mentions within the CSS file for specific small code snippets.*

**If I have forgotten you, please dm me and I'll fix that.**

## Patch Notes
**3/22/22** I have fixed the bug that would cause group DMs to disappear.

If you're having issues installing all 3 parts to the theme, install each one by themselves by using `cd powercord/src/powercord/themes` then `git clone https://github.com/Fahrenheit/Semi-Stock-Discord` then `git clone https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList` and finally `git clone https://github.com/luckfire/bottombar`
