# Semi Stock Discord
A theme I've put together with minor tweaks and some snippets to personalize my experience. It unintentionally seems to mimick the iOS Discord style.

This theme is mainly for macOS as I haven't really tested this on any other platform. Shoot me a message on Discord to give me any bug reports (my handle is Fahrenheight#0001). My macOS title bar modification implementation is a bit hacky so I'll fix that at some point. I've used the platform emulator to test it on Windows and it seems to be solid.

Use this with [HorizontalServerList](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList) by [GibbuPCStuff](https://github.com/GibbuPCStuff/) and [Bottom Bar](https://github.com/luckfire/bottombar) by [LuckFire](https://github.com/luckfire/) 

**All credit goes to them for their respective themes. I just built upon them and did some slight modifications here and there. There are other credit mentions within the CSS file for specific small code snippets.**
**If I have forgotten you please dm me and I'll fix that.**

## Installation

### Powercord

1. clone the repo `cd powercord/src/powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/Fahrenheit/Semi-Stock-Discord && git clone https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList && https://github.com/luckfire/bottombar` 
2. Install [Theme Toggler](https://github.com/redstonekasi/theme-toggler) and enable all 3 themes.

**I can promise you this will be broken and look awful if you don't use those themes with this as it was built with these two in mind.**
