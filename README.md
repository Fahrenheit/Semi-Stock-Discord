# Semi Stock Discord
 Just a few themes plus some snippets and other tweaks I've thrown together to personalize my experience. Mainly for macOS as I haven't really tested this on any other platform. 
 I use this with [HorizontalServerList](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList) by [GibbuPCStuff](https://github.com/GibbuPCStuff/) and [Bottom Bar](https://github.com/luckfire/bottombar) by [LuckFire](https://github.com/luckfire/bottombar)

 I can promise you this will be broken or look awful if you don't use those themes with this.
