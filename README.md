# Semi Stock Discord
A theme I've put together with minor tweaks and some snippets to personalize my experience. It unintentionally seems to mimick the iOS Discord style.
 
This theme is mainly for macOS as I haven't really tested this on any other platform. Shoot me a message on Discord to give me any bug reports (my handle is Fahrenheight#0001). My macOS title bar modification implementation is a bit hacky so I'll fix that at some point. I've used the platform emulator to test it on Windows and it seems to be solid.

Use this with [HorizontalServerList](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList) by [GibbuPCStuff](https://github.com/GibbuPCStuff/) and [Bottom Bar](https://github.com/luckfire/bottombar) by [LuckFire](https://github.com/luckfire/bottombar)

I can promise you this will be broken and look awful if you don't use those themes with this as it was built with these two in mind.
